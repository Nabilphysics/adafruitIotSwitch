  This is a very basic code. I upload it just for an IDEA
  Three or more LED can be controlled by this code using adafruit IoT
  You can press D7 to enter WiFi configuration.
  Builtin LED will blink faster when it is in config mode.
  Builtin LED will be solid when adafruit server connection is achieved.
